# Word Guessing Game

## Overview
Welcome to the Word Guessing Game! This Python script implements a simple word guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly selected word by deciphering a shuffled version of it. The game provides hints, tracks guessed letters, and allows a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play
1. The game begins by selecting a random word from a predefined list, such as "python," "programming," "computer," "game," or "challenge."
2. The chosen word is then shuffled to provide an initial challenge to the player.
3. Players have a set number of attempts (default is 6, but adjustable) to guess the correct word.
4. After each guess, the script displays the shuffled word with correctly guessed letters filled in and underscores for unguessed letters.
5. Players can also request a hint by typing 'hint,' which reveals an unrevealed letter in the word.
6. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download the script (`word_guessing_game.py`) to your local environment.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script by executing `python word_guessing_game.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
